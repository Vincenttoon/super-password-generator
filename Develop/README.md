### User Story
- AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
- I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
- SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

### Developer Notes

This was HARD. A huge step up in difficulty from the previous two challenges. It felt like a lifetime trying to get anything to get anything functioning. Once I figured out the if/else statements things sped up a bit and I started to understand what I was doing a little more. Putting the For loop and Math.random held me up too.
